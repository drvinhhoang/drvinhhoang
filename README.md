# Hi I'm Vinh.

Hi there, I'm Vinh, now I'm working as an iOS developer

### Some projects I did when first started learning iOS programming:

# <img src="Images/icon_60pt@3x.png" width="32" >  Focus In Nature   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1600222896"><img src="Images/download.svg"></a>

##### SwiftUI, AVFounddation, AVKit, Local notification

Minimalist Pomodoro timer, with nature sounds, local notification, haptic feedback, play sound in the background. This literally a timer for minimalists.
I did this project in one week, did everything myself, from designing, to publishing to Appstore.
